            <p class="project-description">
                This project delivers an in-depth analysis of hotel performance data for the Atliq Group, which operates multiple 
                properties across various cities in India. The dashboard is designed to empower stakeholders with data-driven insights 
                into key operational metrics, helping them make informed decisions around revenue optimization and resource management. 
                Built on a robust star schema data model, the solution includes two fact tables (revenue and bookings) and three 
                dimension tables (hotels, dates, and customer segments), ensuring efficient querying and seamless data exploration. 
                The dashboard tracks critical KPIs such as Revenue, Average Daily Rate (ADR), Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR), 
                Occupancy Rate, Daily Sold Room Nights (DSRN), and Realization Percentage. With interactive filters, slicers, and 
                dynamic tooltips, users can analyze performance trends across time, location, customer types, and more, all within a 
                visually engaging and intuitive interface.
                <br><br>
                The project also dives deep into pricing strategies and behavioral trends to identify revenue opportunities. Weekday vs. 
                weekend performance and demand-based pricing patterns are analyzed to guide dynamic pricing decisions that can maximize 
                returns. Additionally, occupancy trends and cancellation patterns are examined to highlight areas of improvement, such as
                overbooking strategies or targeted promotions during low-demand periods. The insights gained from this dashboard enable 
                the Atliq Group to fine-tune their business strategies, minimize revenue leakage, and enhance overall hotel performance. 
                Ultimately, this solution serves as a comprehensive tool for aligning operational efforts with financial goals across 
                their hotel portfolio.

                <ul>
                    <li> Hotels were not using demand-based pricing, leading to flat ADR trends.</li>
                    <li> Introducing dynamic pricing (weekday/weekend) can boost ADR & revenue.</li>
                    <li> Atliq Grands Bangalore & Atliq Seasons Mumbai had the lowest occupancy & highest cancellation rates, indicating possible service/pricing issues.</li>
                    <li> Strategy Recommendation: Maintain uniform pricing across platforms (MakeMyTrip, Agoda) & introduce exclusive direct booking discount coupons.</li>
