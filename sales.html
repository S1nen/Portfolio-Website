                This project focuses on the design and development of an interactive BI dashboard for AtliQ Hardware, a company 
                specializing in computer hardware products. The goal of the dashboard is to analyze sales data comprehensively and 
                provide actionable insights that can drive data-informed decision-making and support revenue growth. Leveraging SQL for 
                data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), the project ensures clean and well-structured data is available for 
                analysis. The dashboard incorporates dynamic filtering options and slicers, allowing users to explore sales metrics 
                across various dimensions such as time period, product category, and region. Through intuitive visualizations, the 
                dashboard highlights sales trends over time, enabling users to identify seasonal fluctuations, emerging patterns, and 
                shifts in market demand.
                <br><br>
                Key areas of analysis include product performance, customer purchase behavior, and regional sales distribution. The 
                dashboard evaluates which product categories and individual hardware items contribute the most to revenue, helping s
                takeholders prioritize inventory and marketing strategies. Regional insights offer a clear picture of where sales are 
                strongest geographically, enabling targeted campaigns and resource allocation. Customer analytics uncover patterns in 
                buying behavior, such as purchase frequency and product preferences, supporting better customer engagement and retention 
                strategies. The insights generated from this solution aim to support a targeted revenue growth goal of at least 7% in 
                the upcoming quarter by aligning sales strategies with real-time data and business intelligence.
